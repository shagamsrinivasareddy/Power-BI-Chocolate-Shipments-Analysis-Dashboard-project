 Project Overview
This repository contains my Chocolate Shipments Analysis Dashboard created using **Power BI. 
The project aims to analyze chocolate shipment data to derive meaningful business insights and visualize them clearly for stakeholders.

How I Built This Dashboard?

1. Data Collection
   - I used the provided Excel dataset (sample-chocolate-shipments-data-all-Apr-2025.xlsx) containing chocolate product shipments, customer orders, and regional details.

2. Data Cleaning & Preparation
   - Removed blank rows and duplicate entries in Power BI Query Editor.
   - Converted date columns to proper date format.
   - Ensured numeric data types for shipment quantities and sales amounts.

3. Data Modeling
   - Created relationships between product, customer, and region tables for effective analysis.
   - Ensured data integrity by defining appropriate keys in the model view.

4. Visualization Design
   - Built visuals such as:
     - Bar charts: Top products by sales quantity.
     - Pie charts: Regional sales distribution.
     - Line graphs: Monthly shipment trends.
     - Cards: Total shipments, total sales.
   - Applied proper color themes and visual formatting for better readability.

5. Dashboard Finalization
   - Organized visuals logically on Power BI canvas.
   - Added titles, slicers (filters) for region and product category to enhance interactivity.
